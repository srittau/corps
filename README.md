The CORBA Roleplaying System (deprecated)

> A very old, never even nearly finished or usable project of mine. This is here for historical curiosity.

----

CORPS is based on CORBA – The Common Object Request Broker Architecture. If you want to participate in developing CORPS, you should have at least some basic knowledge of CORBA. (But don’t despair – I have just basic knowledge myself.) For more see the pages of the [Object Management Group](http://www.omg.org/).

CORPS is divided into five packages:

* [corps-core](https://github.com/srittau/corps/wiki/corps-core): core package, needed by the other packages
* [corps-servers](https://github.com/srittau/corps/wiki/corps-servers): multi-player servers
* [corps-maps](https://github.com/srittau/corps/wiki/corps-maps): libraries and data for handling CORPS maps
* [corps-gtk](https://github.com/srittau/corps/wiki/corps-gtk): gtk+ based clients and tools
* [corps-data](https://github.com/srittau/corps/wiki/corps-data): Additional data such as ready-to-play adventures, maps, etc.

BTW: It’s spelled C-O-R-P-S, but it’s pronounced “corpse”. (I know, I know, the Netscape-Mozilla-thingie is better.)

## Additional Information

* [List of registered Map Sets](https://github.com/srittau/corps/wiki/Map-Sets)
* The CORBA IDL for CORPS

You will find documentation (well at least first tries of something like a documentation) in the package [corps-core](https://github.com/srittau/corps/wiki/corps-core).
