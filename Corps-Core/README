                 CORPS 0.3.0 - The CORBA Roleplaying System
                 ==========================================

What is it?
-----------

This is a very early version of CORPS - The CORBA Roleplaying System. It
is neither ready nor useable in any way. This version was released to
attract new developers.

CORPS is based on CORBA - The Common Object Request Broker Architecture.
If you want to participate in developing CORPS, you should have at least
some basic knowledge of CORBA. (But don't despair - I have just basic
knowledge myself.) For more see the pages of the Object Management Group[1].

CORPS currently consists of six packages:

corps-core
  This is the base-package needed to compile the other packages.

corps-client
  A simple text-only CORPS client.

corps-servers
  This package currently contains two servers:
  o The CORPS gamelist-server - This one acts as a container for games that
    you are offering to remote clients
  o Textserv is a very simple exampleneous implementation of a CORPS game
    server. It takes text (and possibly later pictures and other media) and
    delivers them to all connected clients.

corps-maps
  Shipped with this package are libraries and data needed to use CORPS
  maps with your servers or clients.

corps-gtk
  Currently, this contains two programs, based on Gtk+:
  o GCORPS - A graphical CORPS client. Currently, this one is the only client
    for CORPS.
  o MapTool - A graphical tool to view and edit maps.

corps-cyber
  Contains data needed for playing the roleplaying system "Cyber".

BTW: It's spelled C-O-R-P-S, but it's pronounced "corpse". (I know, I know,
the Netscape-Mozilla-thingie is better.)

Requirements
------------

omniORB 2.5.0 or better
libxml 1.0.0 or better
glib and gtk 1.2.0, gtk-- 1.0.0, and ImLib 1.9.0 or better for support of
maps (required for corps-maps and corps-gtk)

Installing
----------

See the file INSTALL for information about compiling and installing the
package.
