There are four examples:

o A simple text server (as in package corps-servers or corps-infocom)
o A MUD server, enhanced by pictures etc.
o A world-server (as in package corps-cyber)
o The Mech server

                           A Simple Text Server
                           ====================

This kind of server is IRC-like: You enter text and this text is
transmitted to the game. Vice versa, the game sends back text.
There are two variations: In the Infocom server, a text is send
back as reaction to text input sent by the user. TextServ is
always listening to text input and will occasionally send text
to the client. (Not necessarily as reaction to input.)

Both servers enable the client큦 History handler and use its
append_text() method to send text to the user. To request
information they use the InputLine handler. They enable()
the handler immediatly after setup.

The Infocom-Server could set auto_disable to true and reenable()
the handler after sending a text. This would prevent buffering
input.

                      A Multimedia Enhanced MUD Server
                      ================================

This server generally works like the text-servers above. But it is
enhanced by pictures and music. Certain places (rooms) hav pictures
attached to them that are showed when the room is entered.
Additionally, music is played in the background. Therefore the
Display and Sound handlers are also activated. Whenever a
picture is shown the Display큦 show() method is called. For
playing music, the Sound handler큦 play() method is called. After
leaving such a room, Display큦 clear method is called.

Instead of using the Display handler, the Popup handler could be
used. This would have the disadvantage that the popup window
could be in the way and that the game server has no control, when
the window is closed.

                              A World Server
                              ==============

This is a rather complex server. When a new player enters the game,
he is prompted to create a new character. This is performed by
using the Request Form handler. If this is not available, the
server may backfall to using the Input Line handler that most
clients will implement. Alternatively, if the game server uses
a well-known system (such as Cyber) it may ask the client for
an object of its character type, using request_object(). This
way, a more appropriate user interface could be used by the
user.

                             The Mech Server
                             ===============

The Mech Server is a server for a strategic kind of game. FIXME
